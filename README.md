# Code Size Measure and Complexity Measure

This project focuses on measuring code size and complexity using the Halstead approach. The Halstead approach is a software metric technique that provides insights into code characteristics and complexity by analyzing the source code.

## Output

For the Java class `Home1.java`, the following metrics were measured:

- Total lines: 501
- Total blank lines: 80
- Total comment lines: 32
- Total class variables: 1
- Total primitive variables: 6
- Total object variables: 58
- Total decision nodes: 17
- Total heading lines: 38
- Total methods: 26
- Total override methods: 10
- Total inheritance relations: 1
- Total implements relations: 1

Additionally, the occurrence of variables in the code was analyzed:

| Variables | Occurrence |
| --------- | ---------- |
| k         | 15         |
| c         | 137        |
| f         | 108        |
| item      | 22         |
| table     | 46         |
| lt        | 14         |
| rows      | 7          |
| flag      | 4          |
| jcb       | 10         |
| srp       | 10         |
| colms     | 2          |
| tr        | 31         |
| str       | 15         |
| mitem     | 11         |
| temp      | 3          |
| t1        | 6          |

## Description

This project aims to provide insights into the code size and complexity of software projects. It utilizes the Halstead approach to measure code metrics, including lines of code, blank lines, and comment lines.

Additionally, the project analyzes the class variables, distinguishing between primitive variables and object variables. It also evaluates the decision nodes present in the code, which represent conditional statements or loops.

Furthermore, the project measures the number of heading lines, which typically include class or method declarations. It also examines the methods within the Java class, determining the total number of methods and the number of override methods.

The occurrence of variables in the code was also analyzed. The table above shows the variables and their respective occurrence count in the code.

The Halstead approach serves as the foundation for evaluating the code size and complexity. By leveraging the principles of the Halstead approach, this project provides valuable insights into the software's code metrics, allowing developers to understand and optimize their codebase effectively.
